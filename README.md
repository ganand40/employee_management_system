# employee_management_system
Objective - Create a simplified Employee Management System (EMS). This project will cover control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming concepts to manage employee data.

Step 1 - Plan the Data Storage
●	Use a dictionary to store employee data where the keys is the emp_id (Employee ID) and the value is another dictionary containing:

○	name: Employee's name.
○	age: Employee's age.
○	department: Employee's department.
○	salary: Employee's monthly salary.
●	Initialize the dictionary with some sample employee data for testing (e.g., {101: {'name': 'Satya', 'age': 27, 'department': 'HR', 'salary': 50000}}).

Step 2 - Define the Menu System
●	Create a menu that displays the following options:

1.	Add Employee
2.	View All Employees
3.	Search for Employee
4.	Exit
●	Implement a loop to continuously display the menu until the user chooses to Exit.


Step 3 - Add Employee Functionality
1.	Prompt the User to enter the following details for a new employee:

○	emp_id (Employee ID)
○	name (Employee Name)
○	age (Employee Age)
○	department (Employee Department)
○	salary (Employee Salary)

2.	Validate Input: Make sure the Employee ID is unique. If it already exists in the dictionary, ask the user to enter a new ID.

3.	Store the Employee data in the dictionary using the entered emp_id as the key and the other details as values.

4.	Display a message indicating the employee was successfully added.

Step 4 - View All Employees
1.	Display all employees stored in the dictionary.
2.	Format the display in a table-like structure, showing employee details (ID, name, age, department, salary).
3.	If there are no employees in the system, display a message like:
○	"No employees available."

Step 5 - Search for an Employee by ID
1.	Prompt the User to enter the emp_id they want to search for.
2.	Search the Dictionary:
○	If the employee exists, display their details (name, age, department, salary).
○	If the employee does not exist, display a message like:
■	"Employee not found."

Step 6 - Exit the Program
1.	Add an Exit option in the menu.
2.	If the user chooses Exit, display a thank-you message and exit the program.

Project Code Structure
To keep the project organized, break it into functions:
1.	main_menu(): Displays the main menu and calls the appropriate function based on user input.
2.	add_employee(): Adds a new employee to the dictionary.
3.	view_employees(): Displays all employee details.
4.	search_employee(): Searches for an employee by ID.
